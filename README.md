# Library Resources
Resources for Public Libraries and addressing the social and economic need of those "at risk".

These resources are provided by [Beneath the Surface AU](https://beneaththesurface.au) as part of our [Libraries and Homelessness Professionals Development Workshop](https://www.beneaththesurface.au/libraries-and-homelessness-professional-development-workshop).

## [Library Link Usage Tracker](https://github.com/beneaththesurfaceau/Library-Link-Usage-Tracker)

This repository contains scripts for tracking how many times a specific link is accessed on Windows, macOS, and Linux. These scripts log each access to a local file and then open the specified link in the default web browser.
